In the classroom you already did such measurement by hand in octal one: you measured Vin and Vout of a filter at a certain frequency, and repeated the measurement at different frequencies to step through the frequency spectrum. When doing this in an automated fashion, you will have to carefully consider which steps needs to be taken when (done in anticipate), and you will have to think about the optimal implementation  (to be explored in simulate). \n",
