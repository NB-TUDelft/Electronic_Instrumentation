If you want to write your own, improved functions, you may simply add them to *picotools.py*, when they're ready for \"deployment\". You could also create your own library(-ies) to store some of the advanced Voltammetry procedures of your Final Project. So, consider the use case of *picotools* as a basic example and an inspiration towards advanced programming practices with Python.\n",

It wasn't thoroughly tested by a large community, like for example `numpy`, so prepare to encounter many constraints, minimal documentation, and potentially some serious bugs. If that happens, please report them to us or take the matter in your hands and improve them right away.*"
