If you want to write your own, improved functions, you may simply add them to `picotools.py`, when they're ready for \"deployment\".

So, consider the use case of *picotools* as a basic example and an inspiration towards advanced programming practices with Python.\n",

If that happens, please report them to us or take the matter in your hands and improve them right away.*"
