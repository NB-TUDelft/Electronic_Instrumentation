    "### Current-to-voltage converter from an inverting opamp\n",
    "\n",
    "In a properly functioning linear circuit based on an operational amplifier (OPAMP), the 'zero conditions' are met. Refer to the diagram below, which illustrates a typical inverting amplifier configuration.\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mwdocter/nb2214-images/-/raw/main/ELC/opamp12C_1.png\" width=\"700px\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Applying the zero-condition principle, we understand that there's no voltage difference between the inputs of the OPAMP. Consequently, the potential at the inverting input is 0 V.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This creates a point at 0 Volts, making it appear similar to a grounded point. However, this point is unique in that the current flowing to it doesn't dissipate into the circuit's ground system. Instead, it continues through the resistor Rf. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The OPAMP maintains this potential (0 V) by adjusting its output. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Therefore, the output voltage provides an indication of the current flowing into this virtual ground point.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an ideal current meter, which exhibits neither resistance nor voltage loss. In this context, our circuit appears ideal for monitoring a current flowing to ground. \n",
    "\n",
    " - By setting the value of Ri to zero (replacing it with a wire), we establish a current measurement point at a constant ground potential. \n",
    " - The voltage output at the OPAMP, influenced by the known transfer ratio determined by Rf, converts current to voltage. \n",
    " - This output can then be connected to an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Photodiode\n",
    "\n",
    "This circuit is particularly effective for measuring the current produced by a photodiode. A photodiode is a unique semiconductor device that generates a photocurrent when exposed to light. This photocurrent is directly proportional to the intensity of the incident light. When used in different configurations, particularly with an op-amp, the photodiode exhibits distinct characteristics that can be regarded as a light-intensity controlled current source or a voltage source.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two modes that a photodiode can be operated in are explained below: \n",
    "    \n",
    "1. **Photoconductive Mode**: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - In this mode, the photodiode is grounded without any resistor on the input branch, enhancing its responsiveness to light. When light strikes the photodiode, it generates a photocurrent, otherwise knowns as: reverse-current (or leakage current). \n",
    "    - By coupling the photodiode via a low-ohmic impedance (just a simple wire) to the inverting (-) input of the opamp, we can convert this current into a measurable voltage output. Below, the diagram shows how to connect a photodiode as a current source:\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "        <img src=\"https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mwdocter/nb2214-images/-/raw/main/ELC/opamp12C_PC.png\" width=\"700px\"/>\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    - When we connect the photodiode to a **current to voltage converter**, the diode will be practically shorted between the inputs of the OPAMP. (Note: the feedback circuit at the OPAMP, will create the low impedance, not the inputs of the OPAMP themselves!)\n",
    "    - <i>The current-mode can be promoted further by connecting it in such a way that it is reversed biased, but in this experiment, we will not look into reverse biasing.</i>\n",
    "    - This mode emphasizes the photodiode's role as a current source, where **the output voltage is linearly related to the light intensity and the feedback resistor $V_{out} \\propto I_{light} \\cdot R_{f}$,  making it preferable for precise measurements.**\n",
    "    - This means a photodiode generates;\n",
    "        - a very low current when illuminated with with low intensity light and \n",
    "        - a very high current when illuminated with high intensity light. \n",
    "    - One could say that diode is less sensitive, however its output signal is very suitable for intensity measurements in bio-chemical experiments because of its excellent linearity. \n",
    "    - In measurement applications the photodiode will mostly be used in photoconductive mode (current-mode).\n",
    "<br>   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Photovoltaic Mode**: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Alternatively, in the photovoltaic mode, the photodiode operates without any external bias (zero-bias) or also grounded, but with a high load resistor on the input branch leading to a high input impedance. This operation is similar to a solar cell. Here, it generates a voltage in response to light exposure. This mode of operation can be seen as: **voltage amplifier (inverting or non-inverting)**\n",
    "    - By again coupling the photodiode to the inverting (-) input of the opamp, this voltage can be amplified and observed as a output voltage. \n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "        <img src=\"https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mwdocter/nb2214-images/-/raw/main/ELC/opamp12C_PV.png\" width=\"700px\"/>\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    - In this configuration, the photodiode acts as a voltage source (the current is converted to voltage on the resistor), and the output voltage varies with the intensity of the incident light. The voltage generated by the photodiode is again proportional to the light intensity, but the relationship may not be perfectly linear. \n",
    "    - **The curve in this case would generally start linear but could show a leveling off (decreasing sensitivity and eventually saturation) at higher light intensities, which is reminiscent of a switch-like behavior or a very sensitive but an inaccurate detector**  \n"
