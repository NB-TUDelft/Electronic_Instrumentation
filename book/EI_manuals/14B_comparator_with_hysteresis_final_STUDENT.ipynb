    "### 1. Exploring OPAMP as a Comparator\n",
    "In this segment, we delve into the use of an Operational Amplifier (OPAMP) in a unique role—as a comparator. This setup is intriguing because it leverages the OPAMP's high gain without requiring negative feedback. Essentially, the OPAMP's output oscillates between two extremes, clipping against either its positive or negative supply rail, indicating a binary state: either fully positive or fully negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Comparators vs OPAMPs\n",
    "It's important to highlight that there are specialized Integrated Circuits (ICs) designed as comparators. While bearing a resemblance to OPAMPs with differential inputs and high gain, comparators are distinctly engineered to output just two levels: high or low. Unlike OPAMPs, they are unsuitable for linear amplification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Comparator Circuit Analysis\n",
    "The comparator circuit employs one input for reference and another for the signal. When the reference voltage (Vd) is connected to the inverting input and the signal voltage (Vi) to the non-inverting input, the circuit operates in the following manner: If Vi is less than Vd, the output is negative (since Vi - Vd yields a negative result). Conversely, if Vi exceeds Vd, the output turns positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mwdocter/nb2214-images/-/raw/main/ELC/14B_comparator.png\" width=\"100%\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Above is the circuit diagram and its typical behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "> What would change if we would swap both inputs? So Vi to the inverting input and the reference (Vd) to the non-inverting input?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Dealing with Noisy Signals\n",
    "In an ideal world, signals are noise-free, but reality presents us with noisy signals that can lead to erratic behavior in the circuit, as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mwdocter/nb2214-images/-/raw/main/ELC/14B_noisy_signal.png\" width=\"70%\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Noise-induced fluctuations, or 'bouncing', can be problematic. It depends on the applications, but especially in scenarios where the comparator feeds into a counter, \"bouncing\" will lead to counting errors. To mitigate this, we introduce hysteresis into the circuit, altering the switching threshold based on the current output state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing of the switching levels, the hysteresis, is achieved via positive feedback where the output is connected back to the **non-inverting input** through a set of resistors. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: this is not a linear circuit! So we cannot assume that inverting and non-inverting input have the same potential. However, we still assume that no current is flowing into the OPAMPs inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mwdocter/nb2214-images/-/raw/main/ELC/14B_non-inverting_comparator.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram above showcases **a non-inverting comparator.** The output is positive when the input signal surpasses the threshold and negative otherwise.\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Calculating the Switching Levels\n",
    "To determine the switching levels, recognize that:\n",
    "1. The OPAMP compares the voltage on the non-inverting input to the potential on the inverting input (GND).\n",
    "2. The potential on the inverting input is stems from the resistive divider R1 and R2, which are connected between the input voltage and the output voltage.\n",
    "3. At the moment of switching, the potential on the non-inverting input is exactly 0V, meaning that the voltage drop over R2 is equal to Uout, and so the current is Uout/R2.\n",
    "4. The current through R2 flows through R1, creating a voltage drop over R1: \\$(U_{out}/R2) * R1\\$\n",
    "5. Thus, the switching levels are calculated as ± Uout * (R1/R2).\n"
