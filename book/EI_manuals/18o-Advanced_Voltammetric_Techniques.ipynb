Let's not forget, however, that Cyclic Voltammetry, especially when highly customisable, delivers unique insights into reversibility of chemical reactions. \n",

In the previous notebooks, you already encountered the Measurement Cell Model 1 and 2, which you could use for testing your potentiostat and your code. In our experience, a increased complexity of the SWV and DPV procedures may lead to unnoticed bugs in the code that lead to hidden evaluation errors. It turns out that mentioned models might fail to test some aspects of SWV and DPV, like for example whether the forward current and reverse current are associated with the correct cell voltage. Coming up with an accurate test scenario for these procedures might be very difficult, and it certainly requires some creativity. Nevertheless, we would like to invite you to give it a try to come up with some ideas for a suitable test model or a test procedure."
