    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, we have explored circuits that process signals, such as filters and amplifiers. These circuits take an external signal as input, modify it, and provide a processed signal as output. This week, however, we shift focus to a circuit that **generates a signal**: the **relaxation oscillator**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oscillators play a crucial role in enhancing signal quality, particularly in sensor and signal applications. Sensor outputs are often weak and noisy, which can make data readouts unreliable. By incorporating an oscillator, the sensitivity to noise can be reduced, enabling more robust and accurate sensor data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an Oscillator?\n",
    "\n",
    "An oscillator is a circuit designed to generate a repetitive waveform. There are two primary types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Harmonic Oscillator\n",
    "   - Produces a clean sine wave.  \n",
    "   - Utilizes an amplifier and a frequency-determining network.  \n",
    "   - When parameters are balanced, the circuit generates a stable sine wave.  \n",
    "2. Relaxation Oscillator  \n",
    "   - Operates by continuously charging and discharging a capacitor.  \n",
    "   - Various implementations exist, typically charging/discharging between two thresholds (linear or non-linear, e.g., exponential).  \n",
    "   - **The output waveform often appears as a distorted triangle.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Focus of This Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will\n",
    "1. Build **a Relaxation Oscillator Circuit**: Using an integrator and comparator, you will build a device that exhibits a self-sustained oscillation.\n",
    "2. Build **a Tunable Light Source**: You will assemble an OPAMP-based current-controlled light source. This component is crucial for providing a stable and controllable input for your experiment.\n",
    "3. Build **a Light Sensor**: Combine the oscillator with a photodiode to control the frequency of oscillation with light intensity.\n",
    "4. Learn how to **plan your workflow** for a complex build: This assignment will guide you through a process of simulating, testing and tuning of a complex device. \n",

    "In this experiment, we will use an OPAMP-based integrator to charge and discharge a capacitor (which is part of the integrator circuit). The cycle operates as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The capacitor charges until it reaches one threshold of the comparator.\n",
    "- At this point, the comparator switches states, reversing the direction of the charging current.\n",
    "- The capacitor discharges until it reaches the other threshold.\n",
    "- The thresholds are determined by the feedback network of the comparator.\n",

    "### Key characteristics of the circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The voltage across the capacitor (output of the integrator) continuously cycles between two thresholds.\n",
    "2. The comparator output also oscillates between two levels (not necessarily matching the integrator's thresholds).\n",
    "3. The charging speed of the capacitor depends on the integrator's input signal from the photodiode (light intensity) and the capacitor's properties.\n",
    "4. The discharging speed is determined by the current through diode `D1` and `Rc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In this experiment, a **photodiode** is used to generate the charging current as a function of light intensity. To make the circuit dependent only on the photodiode’s intensity, a diode is added so that charging occurs solely via the photodiode. <br><br>\n",
    "> Note: Swapping the polarity of the photodiode and diode `D1` results in a 180-degree phase shift in the oscillation but does not affect the circuit’s functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Photodiode** converts light to a photocurrent.\n",
    "- **Integrator** shapes (integrates) the signal from the photodiode.\n",
    "- **Comparator** acts as a decision-maker, switching based on the integrator's output.\n",

    "\n",
    "Relaxation oscillator coupled with a photodiode operating in the photocoductive mode can act as a sensor and an analog computer converting light intensity into an oscillation frequency.\n",
