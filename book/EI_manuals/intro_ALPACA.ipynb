    "In this course ALPACA means **Advanced Learning Platform for Analog Circuits and Automation** (https://zenodo.org/record/5615137) which is developed specifically for this course by Jeroen Bastemeijer. In short: the ALPACA is a \"pocket Studio Classroom\" with devices on board you can use to do experiments. \n",
    "The ALPACA has (among others):\n",
    "\n",
    "* A computer that can be **programmed** to execute instructions\n",
    "* A simple **function generator**\n",

    "The Alpaca has features to learn about **digital** systems based on a Raspberry Pi Pico. In addition, it has a number of circuits on board which allow you to study **analog** circuits.\n",

    "The ALPACA is comprised of three components:\n",
    "1. The ALPACA board (Colored blue in the video above)\n",
    "2. The Cria board (Colored green)\n",

    "### Installation Step 3: Installing the Alpaca Firmware\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "In order for the ALPACA to know how to respond to your Python code, you need to install MicroPython on the Pico Pi. Follow the instructions below to install Micropython (which we have taken to calling the \"firmware\" of the ALPACA).\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='ff822d' size=6> üìù </font> <font color='ff822d' size=4> **Todo**: </font>\n",

    "1. Download the firmware for the Alpaca (`Alpaca_firmware.uf2`) from <a href=\"https://brightspace.tudelft.nl/d2l/le/content/775335/viewContent/4586102/View\" target=\"_blank\">Brightspace</a>  (hyperlink). \n",
    "2. Remove the USB-B connector (AKA printer cable/power cable) from the ALPACA board.\n",
    "3. Unplug the micro-USB cable that attaches to the ALPACA from your PC.\n",
    "4. While pressing the ‚ÄúBOOTSEL‚Äù button on the ALPACA, reinsert the USB cable into the PC. Let go of the ‚ÄúBOOTSEL‚Äù button after a few seconds. The white, small round \"BOOTSEL\" button is located on the larger green rectangular Raspberry Pi Pico.\n",
    "5. When everything is okay, the ALPACA will appear as an flash drive in File Explorer (Windows)/Finder (MacOS)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The `Alpaca_firmware.utf` downloaded file must be stored on the ALPACA by dragging and dropping it (or copy it in another way).\n",
    "7. When the ALPACA has rebooted, Micropython is active and is ready to run Python instructions or programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ever need to redo this step, you can download or view the manual for installing the firmware (`Alpaca_firmware_manual.pdf`) from <a href=\"https://brightspace.tudelft.nl/d2l/le/content/682272/viewContent/3972819/View\" target=\"_blank\">Brightspace</a>  (hyperlink).\n"
