This limit depends on the level of optimisation of your code, and could be found anywhere between 1000 and 4000+ samples. For example, if one cycle between -0.5V and 1.5V follows `Ustep=1mV`, then your acquisition has 4000 points. Running two cycles at this setting will certainly lead to a memory error. It is therefore essential to set a constraint. For example, to display a warning and set the minimum `Ustep *= Ncycles`.
