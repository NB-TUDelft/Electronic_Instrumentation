    "\n",
    "We would like to propose yet another approach to generating a waveform for cyclic voltammetry with `np.arange()` and `np.concatenate()`. We believe that this approach is more intuitive than the ones proposed before, like the method using the `Triangle`, but feel free to use any technique that gives a correct waveform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking down a CV measurement cycle into segments separated by *vertices* can simplify construction of custom waveforms.\n",
    "In a conventional, one-cycle, voltammetry measurement, the cell potential starts at `Ucell=0` (vertex0), and is swept to the highest positive cell potential `Umax` (vertex1). In the next phase, `Ucell` is swept to `Umin` (vertex2) - typically a negative value. In the last phase, the cell potential is brought back to zero (Vertex3), so this waveform consists of three segments. The choice for the vertices and for their order is dictated by the goals of the measurement, so if you decide to conduct advanced measurements, you might need to design a suitable waveform for each case. \n",
    "\n",
    "> In *Anticipate 2.2*, we listed some parameters for a recommended measurement of Paracetamol, where you will find a list of *vertices* for the first cycle. The optimal waveform for the measurement of Aspirin might be slightly different, but re-using the one recommended for Paracetamol is a good starting point.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the proposed technique, `Ustep` is the control parameter. The NUM_SAMPLES is relaxed and derived from the resulting length of the waveform, e.g. `len(waveform)`. If your `Ustep>5mV`, you can safely work with upto 3 cycles without overloading the Pico, but it's still a good idea to print the length of your final waveform to confirm that it's not too long. \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Example for constructing a conventional waveform for Cyclic Voltammetry using np.arange() and np.concatenate()**\n",
    ">1. Each segment of the waveform can be generated using `np.arange()`, for example:\n",
    ">    - `segment1 = np.arange(vertex0, vertex1, step)` which takes the limiting values of that segment, e.g. `(0, Umax)` <br>and a suitable spacing `step = segment1[i+1]-segment[i]` between the values e.g. `step = Ustep`. Note that it's positive for sweeps going more positive, and negative for sweeps going more negative.\n",
    ">2. All segments can be combined into the waveform representing one complete cycle using `np.concatenate()`, for example;\n",
    ">    - `fullcycle = np.concatenate((segment1, segment2, ...))`\n",
    ">3. Similarly, for multiple cycles, the final waveform is a concatenation of the full cycles.\n",
    ">4. If the starting point of the measurement deviates from the starting point of the default cycle, which is the case for Paracetamol, a custom segment e.g. `prep = np.arange(Ubegin, 0, Ustep)` can be prepended to the full waveform, for example;\n",
