Using the oscilloscope, however, we can also visualize signals in the frequency or spectral domain (amplitude vs. frequency). The process of going from time to spectral domain is called a Fourier transform. The details will be explained later in much more detail during the course Signals and Systems. Here, we will limit to observe the spectral domain of different waveforms in a qualitative way. \n",
