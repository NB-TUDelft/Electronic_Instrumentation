    "*So far we have visualized our signals only in the time domain (amplitude vs. time). Using the oscilloscope, however, we can also visualize signals in the frequency or spectral domain (amplitude vs. frequency). The process of going from time to spectral domain is called a Fourier transform. The details will be explained later in much more detail during the labview sessions and the course Signals and Systems. Here, we will limit to observe the spectral domain of different waveforms in a qualitative way. In **Analysis**, you learned that the Fourier transform converts a function in the time domain $f(t)$ to a function in the frequency domain $\\hat{f}(\\omega)$, just the way a prisma splits a white light beam into all its constitutive colours, displaying the frequency spectrum of the white light. Remember that the equation for the Fourier transform is:*\n",

A block wave is always defined by a certain periodic subset of frequencies. To get a triangular wave, the higher harmonics must be blocked (as you more closely approach a single-frequency sine wave).In the image below you can see the Fourier Transform of a sine wave. You can calculate this mathematically, however, that is not at all necessary for this course. You should simply understand that this is what a FT of a sine wave looks like and that a fourier transform converts time to frequency domains.*\n",
