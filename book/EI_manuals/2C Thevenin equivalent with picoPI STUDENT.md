# Experiment 2C: Use the picopi to measure the Thevenin equivalent of a circuit

> <font color='blue'>Learning goal:</font> Predict the Thevenin equivalent of a circuit and measure it with the Alpaca. 

## Background Thevenin
> <font color='grey'>‚è≥ Estimated time: 15 min</font>

You can replace each complicated circuit with one or multiple sources with many resistors, by a much simpler one with only one source and one resistor. This one source can be a voltage source (Thevenin equivalance) or current source (Norton equivalence): 

<img src="https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mwdocter/nb2214-images/-/raw/main/LTS/2C_thev_norton_equiv.JPG          " width=50% ></img>

Measuring the Thevenin voltage of any complex circuit can be done by placing a voltage meter (with infinite resistance) at the location of Vout.  <br>
Measuring the Norton current is done by placing a current meter (with no resistance) at the location of Vout.<br>
Since the two equivalents behave the same, you can deduct that Rth=Rn=Vth/In.
You can measure this equivalent resistance by turning off the sources, and measure the resistance at Vout. If you do this on paper, you will:
1. replace the sources by their internal resistance
    * a current source has infinite resistance (hence is replaced by a broken wire)
    * a voltage source has no resistance (hence is replaced by a wire)
2. combine all resistors, start with the one furthest away from the measurement point (Vout)

If you have multiple sources, then you need to use superposition: 
* replace all other sources by their internal resistance
* derive the contribution of each source independently
* sum all contributions of all sources.  

Note, when looking at the resistances of meters and/or sources, please remember:
* a current source and a volt meter have (ideally) infinite resistance, and are replaced by a broken wire
* a voltage source and a current meter have (ideally) no resistance, and are replaced by a connected wire

Watch the movie(s) below on the Thevenin equivalent (voltage source+resistor) and Norton equivalent (current source plus resistor).

If the movies don't run, you could try to switch the Kernel to python3. For the use of the picopi, you will later on have to switch it back to ALPACA-kernel

## Background ALPACA 
> <font color='grey'>‚è≥ Estimated time: 5 min</font>

You'll be learning to how take electronic measurements by means of programmed instructions. For this you will not only use  the classroom equipment, but also an ALPACA. This Advanced Learning Platform for Analog Circuits and Automation (https://zenodo.org/record/5615137) is developed specifically for this course by Jeroen Bastemeijer. In short: the ALPACA is a "pocket Studio Classroom" with devices on board you can use to do experiments. 
The ALPACA has (among others):

* A computer that can be **programmed** to execute instructions
* A simple **function generator**
* A means of **sampling** input signals
* A **breadboard** where you can build circuits


![ChessUrl](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mwdocter/nb2214-images/-/raw/main/PicoPI/picopi1_2_assembly.gif "Alpaca+Cria+Picopi")

The Alpaca has features to learn about **digital** systems based on a Raspberry Pi Pico. In addition, it has a number of circuits on board which allow you to study **analog** circuits.

The ALPACA is comprised of three components:
1. The ALPACA board (Colored blue in the video above)
2. The Cria board (Colored green)
3. The Raspberry Pi Pico (AKA "PicoPi", colored red)

<img src="https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mwdocter/nb2214-images/-/raw/a894a02ef157ca15d3d118eb243245eb912ba4f0/PicoPI/picopi1_11_Flowchart - Visual overview of Pico functionality.jpg" width=50% ></img>

The ALPACA contains a lot of features that can be experimented with. We will consider four features that are relevant to Electronic Instrumentation. Each of these functions is accessed via different methods in either the `machine` module or the `functiongenerator` module.

## Background(Homework): Install the ALPACA software
> <font color='grey'>‚è≥ Estimated time: 30 min</font>

Before you can start using your ALPACA, you'll need to complete three installation steps **once**. These steps are extensively documented in this notebook.

1. Install Miniconda
2. Create an Miniconda Environment
3. Install the ALPACA firmware on the ALPACA 

You'll also learn how to download Jupyter Notebooks to your computer and **run them locally**, rather that from Vocareum. You'll do this for each PicoPi Notebook you make.


> <font size=6>‚ÑπÔ∏è</font>
>
> <font color='00a6ed'> Good news: once you've succesfully installed everything, you'll only need to download the notebook again for other Pico Pi assignments. Steps 1-3 only need to be performed once.
    </font>

### Installation Step 2: Creating a Python Environment

<font color='ff822d' size=6> üìù </font> <font color='ff822d' size=4> **Todo**: </font>
    
1. Download a "recipe" file for the environment to your computer. Please consult the table below:

<!-- #region kernel="SoS" -->
### Installation Step 3: Installing the Alpaca Firmware

   
In order for the ALPACA to know how to respond to your Python code, you need to install MicroPython on the Pico Pi. Follow the instructions below to install Micropython (which we have taken to calling the "firmware" of the ALPACA).

<font color='ff822d' size=6> üìù <font> <font color='ff822d' size=4> **Todo**: <font>

1. Download the firmware for the Alpaca (`Alpaca_firmware.utf`) from <a href="https://brightspace.tudelft.nl/d2l/le/content/682272/viewContent/3972992/View" target="_blank">Brightspace</a>  (hyperlink). 
2. Remove the USB-B connector (AKA printer cable/power cable) from the ALPACA board.
3. Unplug the micro-USB cable that attaches to the ALPACA from your PC.
4. While pressing the ‚ÄúBOOTSEL‚Äù button on the ALPACA, reinsert the USB cable into the PC. Let go of the ‚ÄúBOOTSEL‚Äù button after a few seconds. The white, small round "BOOTSEL" button is located on the larger green rectangular Raspberry Pi Pico.
5. When everything is okay, the ALPACA will appear as an flash drive in File Explorer (Windows)/Finder (MacOS)

6. The `Alpaca_firmware.utf` downloaded file must be stored on the ALPACA by dragging and dropping it (or copy it in another way).
7. When the ALPACA has rebooted, Micropython is active and is ready to run Python instructions or programs.

If you ever need to redo this step, you can download or view the manual for installing the firmware (`Alpaca_firmware_manual.pdf`) from <a href="https://brightspace.tudelft.nl/d2l/le/content/682272/viewContent/3972992/View" target="_blank">Brightspace</a>  (hyperlink).

## Anticipate: What will be the Thevenin equivalent of the following circuit?
> <font color='grey'>‚è≥ Estimated time: 25 min</font>

In the following circuit two sources are used: V1 and V2. With help of a set resistors these two sources are combined. 

<img src="https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mwdocter/nb2214-images/-/raw/main/LTS/thevenin circuit ALPACA.JPG" width=50%></img>

* Predict which voltage you would measure between location A and B (=V_thevenin)
* If you replace this circuit by its equivalent one with a source with V_thevenin, which (Thevenin) resistor would you need to add?



```python
### TO DO=" your predicted values "

```

## Simulate: find the Thevenin equivalent of the above circuit 
> <font color='grey'>‚è≥ Estimated time: 10 min</font>

From now on, LTSpice will be used to verify your written predictions. In order to reduce the workload in this assignment, reuse your stacked voltage divider simulation. Don't forget to save it under a different name. 
As can be seen in the figure below, you use the same resistors, but different voltage sources. 

* What is the Thevenin voltage? (Hint: Vthevenin= Vout1=Vout2)
* Find the Thevenin resistance, via the Norton current. 
    * add a small resistor (1e-6, or 1e-9) at the bottom, to connect Vout to ground.
    * measure the current through the small resistor, this is the Norton current
* if your simulation and prediction do not agree, solve your mistake

```python

### Installation Step 4: Downloading this Notebook 

You're nearly there! This is a **Jupyter Notebook**, a document that can contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text. You will be using these notebooks throughout Electronic Instrumentation. Jupyter Notebooks consist of **cells**. Cells like this one simply contain text, while others contain code.

Chances are, that you are currently viewing this notebook from **Vocareum**. Vocareum will be your go-to location for accessing new notebooks with assignments. Because Vocereum lives in the cloud and is accessed via a browser, it cannot interface with any electronics connected to your PC, including the ALPACA. So, Jupyter Notebook needs to be run **locally** (from your device), rather than from the browser.

1. Download the Notebook from the toolbar at the top of the screen: `File` > `Download as` > `Notebook (.ipynb)`. Save the file to a convenient location on your PC.

2. Open **Miniconda Prompt**. 

    On Windows, this can be done via the Start menu. Alternatively, the pressing the Windows key will bring up a search bar in which `Miniconda Prompt` can be typed. Once the search bar highlights the appropriate application, simply press `Enter`.
    
    On MacOS, this can be done via   Terminal. Simultaneously press the `Command` and `Space` keys to bring up Spolight, type `Terminal`, and hit `Enter`.
    
    > <font size=6>‚ÑπÔ∏è</font>
    >
    > <font color='00a6ed'> On a Windows machine, make sure to use Miniconda prompt, and not Windows Terminal! 
    <font>

3. Once Miniconda Prompt has started. You'll need to change the environment from `base (root)` to `nb2214-2024`, if this is not the case already. This can be done using the following command:
    ```bash
    conda activate nb2214-2024
    ```

4. Using the terminal, navigate to the directory in which you have placed the notebook. Do this by typing `cd` into Miniconda Prompt. Then go to File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (MacOS) and find the folder in which the notebook `.ipynb` file lives. Drag the file onto Miniconda prompt. Press enter. For example, if `2C Thevenin equivalent with picoPI.ipynb` is placed on the desktop, your Miniconda Prompt will look something like:
    ```bash
    cd "C:\Users\USERNAME\Desktop"
    ```
    Pressing `Enter` will change the working directory of Miniconda. You'll notice a change in the path between `nb2214-2024` and `>`.
        
        
5. Finally, Jupyter Notebook can be opened by typing:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

6. A browser interface will open. Find the notebook. The file name should be `2C Thevenin equivalent with picoPI.ipynb`. Clicking on the file opens the notebook. Close the instance of the notebook running in Vocareum. **Continue using the local instance.** You should be able to see the images in the local instance as well.
        
        
7. When using the ALPACA on a local instance, you'll need to tell Jupyter that you want to **execute code on the ALPACA rather than on your computer**. This can be done by navigating to the top toolbar of Jupyter and selecting `Kernel` > `Change Kernel` > `ALPACA - USB` or `ALPACA kernel`.
<!-- #endregion -->

With the ALPACA you can generate and acquire digital and analog signals. Introducing you to all of that is too much for today, so we will focus on doing building a circuit and measuring the generated Vout. 



<!-- #region kernel="MicroPython - USB" -->
## Implement &Investigate 1: Measure a voltage with the ALPACA
> <font color='grey'>‚è≥ Estimated time: 10 min</font>

There are two ways of measuring the voltage: with the voltmeter, and reading an Anolog Input Channel. 

The PicoPi can only handle voltages up to 3.3V. Therefore, it is highly recommended to test the voltage level of your output signal before connecting it to the picoPI. 

### Make a variable voltage source, and measure Vout with the voltmeter
* At the **potentiometer** (AKA "potmeter") on the Alpaca, connect the leftmost pin to +12V and the rightmost pin to -12V. +12V and -12 V can be found just below the white breadboard. 

<img src="https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mwdocter/nb2214-images/-/raw/a894a02ef157ca15d3d118eb243245eb912ba4f0/PicoPI/picopi1_15_potmeter.jpg" width=50% style="float:right"></img>

* The middle pin of the potmeter goes to the Voltmeter (left column 4th pin of the Multifunction connector on the Cria). 

<img src="https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mwdocter/nb2214-images/-/raw/a894a02ef157ca15d3d118eb243245eb912ba4f0/PicoPI/picopi1_17_voltmeter 2.jpg" width=50% style="float:right"></img>

* Turn the knob of the potmeter, and observe the polarity and voltage levels change (visualised by the LEDs of the voltmeter). 
    * What would the color of the voltmeter LED mean?
    * Which voltages (and polarity) are allowed on Digital In pin `Din3 - GP21`?
    * What happens to the voltage measured, if you remove the wire connected to the +12V of the potmeter? What would have happened with the Alpaca input pins? What does this mean for cleaning up the circuit, which wire to start with?


<!-- #endregion -->

```python
### TO DO=" which voltages and polarity are allowed on the digital pins" 


### TO DO="what happens if you remove +12V? In which order should you clean up the circuit?" 

```

<img src="https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mwdocter/nb2214-images/-/raw/main/PicoPI/2c_voltmeter_test.jpg" width="75%"/>

* Pay attention to cleaning up the circuit: **remove the signal wires first**. So first remove the wire from the middle pin. **WHY?** Well, if you remove one of the outer pins, there is no divider and current anymore, and the middle pin goes to the still attached + or -12V. 
* Luckily the middle pin was connected to the voltmeter, but if it was connected to the Analog or Digital Inputs you would have damaged your picoPI (replacement is possible, but depends on availability of our soldering expert and results in delay on your side). 

Feel free to watch the recording with some extra tips on the voltmeter and the ALPACA all the way at the bottom of this assignment.

## Implement&Investigate 2: Build the circuit on the Alpaca Breadboard
> <font color='grey'>‚è≥ Estimated time: 30 min</font>



### Find the correct resistors
In order to find the right resistors amongst all provided to you, look at their color coding:

<img src="https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mwdocter/nb2214-images/-/raw/a894a02ef157ca15d3d118eb243245eb912ba4f0/PicoPI/picopi2_3_pico1-resistor_colors.jpg" width=35% ></img>
    
In this practicum, you'll mostly encounter 4-band or 5-band color code. For example a 10k resistor can be:
* 4 band brown (1)- black (0) - orange (3) - (some tolerance) --> 10 * 10^3 = 10000
* 5 band brown (1)- black (0) - black (0) - red (2) - (some tolerance) --> 100 * 10^2 = 10000

Feel free to use online resistor color code calculators like https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/conversion-calculators/conversion-calculator-resistor-color-code

### Using the breadboard
    
The breadboard has the pins on a row (in the middle) and column (on the edges) connected. Therefore wisely position your resistor (vertically). :  
    
<img src="https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mwdocter/nb2214-images/-/raw/a894a02ef157ca15d3d118eb243245eb912ba4f0/PicoPI/picopi2_4_pico1-use_breadboard.jpg" width=70% ></img>

### Build the circuit on the breadboard

<img src="https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mwdocter/nb2214-images/-/raw/main/LTS/thevenin circuit ALPACA.JPG" width=50%></img>

Eventually you will be able to build your own circuit on the ALPACA. Till that time, as inspiration and verification, an example circuit design is given.

### Connect Vin and measure the output power with the Voltmeter

The Vin comes from 3V3 OUT and 5V Vsys, and you measure with the voltmeter. Only if it is safe (+ polarity, <3.5V), you can continu to the next part, record the analog Vin via the Alpaca.

<!-- #region -->
## Implement&Investigate 3:  Connect to the Alpaca 
> <font color='grey'>‚è≥ Estimated time: 5 min</font>

Before starting, a connection to the ALPACA needs to be established. This is done by using a micro-USB cable to connect the PicoPi to a PC. In order to connect to the PicoPi, we need to know which `COM` port it is connected to. This `COM` port is simply how the computer tells apart which devices it is connected to (using a serial port interface). You might already have figured out which it is on your device. If you don't know this yet, follow the steps below:

---
**On Windows:**
<img src="https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mwdocter/nb2214-images/-/raw/a894a02ef157ca15d3d118eb243245eb912ba4f0/PicoPI/picopi1_6_device manager.jpg" width=50% style="float:right"></img>
* Press the Windows key
* Type "device manager" and hit `enter`
* Find the category called `Ports (COM & LPT)` and press the `>` icon to open the drop-down menu
* Here you'll find all the devices connected via `COM` ports. The exact name and number will differ from device to device, but Pico will most likely be the device called `USB Serial Device (COM#)`, where `#` is a single-digit number. In the image below, this number is 4. 

---
**On MacOS:**
* Press the `Command` + `Space`
* In the search bar that pops up, type `Terminal`
* When a result pops up, press enter. A command line window will open.
* Into the command line, type the following: `ls /dev/tty.*`
* Devices connected over serial will then be listed in the format: `screen /dev/tty.[yourSerialPortName] [yourBaudRate]`


---
**Now it is time to connect.** In the cell below, enter the appropraite `COM` port. Your code should look something like: 

`%serialconnect to --port="COM4"`
<!-- #endregion -->

```python

%serialconnect to --port="COM3" 

```

<!-- #region kernel="MicroPython - USB" -->

> <font size=6>‚ÑπÔ∏è</font>

## Implement&Investigate 4: Record Vout 
> <font color='grey'>‚è≥ Estimated time: 5 min</font>

Only when it is safe, connect Vout not only to the voltmeter but also to pin Ain0 (also on the mulitfunction connector). Run the code below and see whether you measured the Thevenin voltage of the circuit correctly. 

```python
from functiongenerator import FuncGen, Sine
import machine
import time
 
a0 = machine.ADC(26)

samples = []

with FuncGen(Sine(Vpp=2, offset=2, freq=25)):
    voltage = a0.read_u16() * 5.0354e-05 
    ## 3.3V corresponds to 32 bits, or 2**32=65536. From this you can derive the conversion factor 5.034e-05
    samples.append(voltage)
print(samples)


```

 > you know measure the Thevenin voltage, but not yet the Thevenin resistance. WIth the Alpaca you can only measure voltage. 
 > 1. imagine you could add an additional small load, say 100 $Ohm$, how could you use that in order to determine Thevenin resistance (in combination with your above measurement)
 > 2. Add such resistor, do the measurement, and derive Thevenin resistance. Does it match your prediction?

```python
### TO DO ="optional challenge: describe how you found the value for the Thevenin resistance"

```

* Wait till all (4) group members finish their observation
* Compare your results with your other group members. 
* If your results agree, and are in line with all predictions, then talk to a TA and get checked off
* Otherwise, so if your results do not agree, or your results are not in line with your predictions, then first discuss amongst your group before getting a TA. 
 

**to be checked off by a TA:** <br>
1. Which voltages are safe to use on the Analog Input, and why you should use the Cria's Voltmeter before connecting Analog Input to the PicoPi?
2. the Thevenin equivalent of the given circuit schematic (including the measurement) 
3. exit card: 1. Write a brief abstract on what you learned (conclusion, useful graph), 2. Which troubleshooting skills do you want to remember for next sessions, 3. Which code do you copy for use in next sessions,
4. How do think this notebook could be improved
