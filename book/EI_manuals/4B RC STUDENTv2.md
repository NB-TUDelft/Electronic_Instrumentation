## SIMULATE: RC circuit 3dB point 
> <font color='grey'>‚è≥ Estimated time: 10 min</font>

You can download the file called "4_RC_CR_RCCR_Simulate" which should contain an RC circuit that looks like this:

You can run this simulation and by right-clicking on the voltage source you can see that you are performing an AC Analysis. This varies the frequency between 1kHz-10kHz such that you can plot Vout to find the -3dB point.

You will implement the circuit, do measurements and analyze them. The assignment is broken into two steps: 
1. Implement the circuit and acquire data 
2. Investigate, by analyzing the acquired data

## IMPLEMENT&INVESTIGATE 1: Step function
> <font color='grey'>‚è≥ Estimated time: 30 min</font>

You will build the RC circuit as below on your Alpaca (220nF is the big flat red capacitor):

We will now use a script that: 
1. Takes 50 samples of the output signal, while the input signal generated by *Dout0* is 0V. 
2. After these 50 measurements, the voltage of *Dout0* is put to 3.3V, and 450 additional samples of the output are performed. 
3. For each measurement, the time at which the measurment was performed is recorded. 
4. The measured output versus the time is plotted.

> To keep track of when each measurement was taken, consider the following approach: 
> - Record the time at the start of the measurement.
> - Store the time at the start of your measurement in a variable `start`. 
> - Each time you measure, check the time again. Subtracting this time from the start time will yield the time elapsed since the start of the measurement!
> - What do you think will be more reliable: an array that interpolates between the start time and the end time or the measured time?
>
> **How to do this in MicroPython:** As you are measuring using a delay of just 4 milliseconds, you might want to meausure these times in milliseconds too, rather than full seconds. To do this, use `time.ticks_ms`. This gives a "time" in milliseconds. Explore how this works in the code below. Equivalently, instead of `time.sleep`, you can also use `time.sleep_ms` to specify a time to sleep in milliseconds. <font>
<!-- #endregion -->

First change the COM port in the code below and run the code of the next cell. 

```python
%serialconnect to --port="COM4" 
```

```python
#### Explore measuring time points in milliseconds using this code ####
# if you want to explore, change the code from if 0: to if 1:
import time

if 0:
    start = time.ticks_ms() # Current time measured in milliseconds
    tt = [] # List to store time points

    for ii in range(600):
        tt.append(time.ticks_ms() - start) # Store time
        time.sleep_ms(4) # delay

    print(tt[0:50]) #do you see multiples of 4 ms?

```

## IMPLEMENT & INVESTIGATE 2: Time constant 
> <font color='grey'>‚è≥ Estimated time: 10 min</font>

Above, you have made a plot of the data. We can now determine the time constant $\tau $ experimetaly. Fill in the missing threshold value (???) in the code below to calculate the time constant automatically and print the value to the console. 
> <font size=6>‚ÑπÔ∏è</font>
>
> <font color='00a6ed'> 
>The time constant is the time it takes until the signal reaches about exp$^{-1}$ of its maximum value. You can also think about this as a timepoint when the Vout is equal to e$^{-1}$*Vmax. When you input the threshold into the code, it will find for you that timepoint.


```python

voltages= samples_OUT * 3.3 / 65535
idx = np.argmax(voltages) # Index where voltage drop starts, argmax returns the first for multiple maxima

tt_start = tt[idx]
voltages_clipped = voltages[idx:]
tt_clipped = tt[idx:]

#Calculate time constant automatically
'''
Write code here, including defining a threshold=???? in order to find the crossing with that threshold. 
Think about capacitor discharge time and realise you want to find tau=RC, and input the correct formula accordingly as a threshold
Hint: Remember the voltage that was set 
'''

### TO DO="threshold =???, #for you to fill in"


tt_37_percent = tt_clipped[np.argmax(voltages_clipped < threshold)] # get first value where sample > threshold, check out np.argmax
tau = tt_37_percent - tt_start
print(f"The time contant is {tau} miliseconds.")

plt.plot(tt_clipped, voltages_clipped, '.-', color='b', label='V_out [V]')
plt.vlines(tt_start, 0, 3.3, color='grey', label='Dout0 is ON [ms]', linestyle='dashed')
plt.vlines(tt_37_percent, 0, 3.3, color='grey', label='Threshold reached [ms]', linestyle='dashed')
plt.hlines(threshold, tt_clipped[0], tt_clipped[-1], color='magenta', label='Threshold [V]', linestyle='dotted' )
#plt.hlines(threshold, tt_clipped[0], tt_37_percent, color='black', label='RC Time', linestyle='solid' )
plt.xlabel("Time [ms]")

plt.ylabel("Voltage [V]")
plt.legend()

```

```python
print('Summary of the measurement:\n')
print('Samples 50 to 60 acquired from Dout0 [V]:',voltages[50:60])
print('Associated timestamps [ms]:',tt[50:60], '\n')
print('Index of the first sample when Dout0 is enabled:', np.argmax(voltages==np.max(voltages)))
#print('Index of the sample with the (first) recorded maximum value:', np.argmax(voltages))
print('Time when Dout0 is enabled [ms]: ', tt_start)
print('V_out when Dout0 is enabled [V]: ', voltages[np.argmax(voltages==np.max(voltages))], '\n')

print('Threshold value [V]: ', threshold, '\n') 
print('Index of the sample with the measurement below the threshold: ', int(np.argmax(voltages==np.max(voltages))+np.argmax(voltages_clipped < threshold)))

## COMPARE & CONCLUDE (first within your group, then with the TA)
> <font color='grey'>‚è≥ Estimated time: 5 min</font>
* Wait until all (4) group members finish their observation
* Compare your results with your other group members. 
* If your results agree, and are in line with all predictions, then talk to a TA and get checked off
* Otherwise, so if your results do not agree, or your results are not in line with your predictions, then first discuss amongst your group before getting a TA. 

**to be checked off by a TA:** 
1. What is the value of the cut-off frequency? 
2. How does the calculated time constant compare to the theoretical value? Please explain the (expected) difference.
3. exit card: 1. Write a brief abstract on what you learned (conclusion, useful graph), 2. Which troubleshooting skills do you want to remember for next sessions, 3. Which code do you copy for use in next sessions,
4. How do think this notebook could be improved

**This notebook is on your laptop. To complete the opportunity for TA+teachers, upload this notebook again into Vocareum + submit**
