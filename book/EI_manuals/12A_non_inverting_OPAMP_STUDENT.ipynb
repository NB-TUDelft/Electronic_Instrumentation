    "There are two basic OPAMP circuits, the inverting and the non-inverting amplifier, most other OPAMP based circuits are derived from these two circuits. These circuits work for both AC and DC signals. During the experiments we will see what the difference is between AC-coupling and DC-coupling of signals, as well.\n",
    "OPAMPs are very often used in conjunction with sensors. Example of a sensor, often used in biochemical systems, is the photodiode. The photodiode is sensitive to light. It can be read out in two different modes; voltage mode and current mode. In voltage mode it will act as a “solar cell”, this gives with low light intensity already a voltage. However, the voltage mode is not linear. When used as an intensity sensor, with high linearity, the current mode is more suited. In order to convert the photocurrent to a voltage, a circuit with an OPAMP is used, the current to voltage converter.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Operational Amplifier is actually a circuit on its own. It is an **integrated** circuit, which means that is composed of dozens of transistors, resistors, diodes and capacitors, these are build on a silicon chip. An OPAMP is an **active component**, which means that it needs energy in order to function. This is contrary to capacitors, resistors and inductors, these components do not need an extra energy-source in order to work properly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The energy needed for the OPAMP to work is supplied by a power supply. On the ALPACA this means the OPAMP needs the +12V and the -12V. Without these power supplies connected, the OPAMP can not be used. As this is such a logical thing, the power supply lines are very often not drawn in the circuit, advantage of this omission is less clutter in the schematic diagram. However, **never forget to connect the power supply pins when building a circuit**!\n",
    "\n",
    "A powered OPAMP will behave as an amplifier with a coarsely defined, but enormous high gain. This high gain makes the component on its own rather useless, but with the proper extra circuitry around it, it will make a very useful circuit e.g. an amplifier. The extra components used are passive components, very often a few resistors. By feeding a part of the output signal back to the input, in counter phase, we can “tame” the OPAMP. Nice thing is that in this scenario, the resistors determine the total behavior of the circuit.\n",
    "One of the basic-forms of these circuits is a non-inverting amplifier, which is shown below <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mwdocter/nb2214-images/-/raw/main/PicoPI/12A%20general%20non%20inverting%20amplifier%20circuit.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "<\n",
    "\n",
    "By changing the value of the resistors we can determine the amplification factor of the circuit, the gain is the ratio “Uout/Uin”.\n",
    "When the circuit works properly, the so called “zero-conditions” apply. In short:\n",
    "- there is no voltage difference between the input marked “+” (non-inverting input) and the one marked “-” (inverting input)\n",
    "- there is no current flowing into the input-pins of the OP\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A third zero condition, often not mentioned, is that the output behaves as a voltage source with “zero ohm” output impedance.\n",
    "\n",
    "An OPAMP is designed to be as ideal as possible. Therefore special (internal) components are selected at the input of the OPAMP which require basically no current on their inputs to operate. As there is next to none current flowing the **input-impedance or resistance is very high**. A value in the Giga-Ohm range is not an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the OPAMP is constructed such that it behaves as a voltage source. This means it has a very low internal resistance. Just a side-note: the output is current limited till ~25mA, but as long as the current stays below this threshold the **output can be regarded as a voltage source with zero Ohm internal resistance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above characteristics, an OPAMP is used very often as a **“buffer”**. A buffer amplifies the signal with a factor of one (0 dB). So the signal coming out has the same amplitude as the signal coming in. However, the signal is fed into an input with very high resistance, so it is not loading the source (e.g. a sensor). The output behaves as a voltage source, so it is capable of feeding the signal into a load (e.g. a long coaxial cable).\n",
    "\n",
    "A buffer can be constructed very easily by connecting the output of the OPAMP to the inverting input directly. The input signal is connected to the non-inverting input.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the OPAMP’s (inverting) input has a high resistance, the feedback from the output to the inverting input can be through a resistor as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "This topology is closely related to the **non-inverting amplifier**. The non-inverting amplifier has a high input resistance, low output resistance, but, in contrast with the buffer, it will increase the gain of the input-signal. In order to get amplification of the signal we apply a feedback network, which is connected between the output and the inverting input (resistors Ra and Rb as seen in the schematic below).\n",
    "\n",
    "The OPAMP can be seen as a regulator, keeping both inputs at the same level. This level is dictated (here) by the voltage on the non-inverting input. The OPAMP is going to regulate its output such, that the inverting input will be at the same level as the non-inverting input. As the output signal is attenuated by Ra and Rb, the output should increase more in order to get both inputs at equal potential. Hence this circuit will act as an amplifier. The output signal is (1 + (Ra / Rb)) larger then the input signal."
