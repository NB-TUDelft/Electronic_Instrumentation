    "### 1. Exploring Sensor-Bridge Applications\n",
    "In this experiment, we delve into the practical application of a sensor-bridge. Sensor bridges are particularly useful with sensors that exhibit higher sensitivity to secondary parameters other than the one being primarily measured. Here, we focus on a bridge constructed with resistors sensitive to magnetic fields, which are, notably, even more sensitive to temperature changes!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Balancing Sensitivities in the Bridge\n",
    "To offset the varying sensitivities, the bridge is designed with two resistors having a negative coefficient for the targeted parameter (magnetic field) and two with a positive coefficient. This configuration enables the creation of a functional system, even though all resistors share the same sensitivity coefficient for temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Instrumentation Amplifier vs OPAMP\n",
    "While the schematic of an instrumentation amplifier may resemble that of an Operational Amplifier (OPAMP), their functionalities differ. The instrumentation amplifier, a specialized form of a differential amplifier, amplifies the voltage difference between its inverting and non-inverting inputs with an adjustable gain-factor. This gain is set using an external resistor (Rg).\n",

    "The diagram above illustrates how resistors react to magnetic fields, with all resistors demonstrating a positive coefficient (+dR) in response to temperature changes. In the absence of a magnetic field, all resistors maintain equal value, resulting in output voltages Ul and Ur being half the bridge voltage. Temperature-induced resistance changes, equal in all resistors, will similarly maintain this half-bridge voltage balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when exposed to a magnetic field, two resistors increase their resistance while the other two decrease it. This creates a small but significant deviation from the half-bridge voltage, yielding a differential voltage (Ur - Ul). This differential voltage is then amplified by the instrumentation amplifier to a usable level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Bridge Output Voltage Dependency\n",
    "For a full bridge configuration with four sensitive resistors, the differential output voltage can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Uo = U_{bridge} \\times \\frac{dR}{R} $$\n",
    "\n",
