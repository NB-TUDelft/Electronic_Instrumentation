    "### 1. Exploring Sensor-Bridge Applications\n",
    "In this experiment, we delve into the practical application of a sensor-bridge. Sensor bridges are particularly useful with sensors that exhibit higher sensitivity to secondary parameters other than the one being primarily measured. Here, we focus on a bridge constructed with resistors sensitive to magnetic fields, which are, notably, even more sensitive to temperature changes!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Balancing Sensitivities in the Bridge\n",
    "To offset the varying sensitivities, the bridge is designed with two resistors having a negative coefficient for the targeted parameter (magnetic field) and two with a positive coefficient. This configuration enables the creation of a functional system, even though all resistors share the same sensitivity coefficient for temperature.\n",

    "### 3. Instrumentation Amplifier vs OPAMP\n",
    "While the schematic of an instrumentation amplifier may resemble that of an Operational Amplifier (OPAMP), their functionalities differ. The instrumentation amplifier, a specialized form of a differential amplifier, amplifies the voltage difference between its inverting and non-inverting inputs with an adjustable gain-factor. This gain is set using an external resistor (Rg).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Understanding the Behavior under Magnetic Fields and Temperature\n",
    "The diagram above illustrates how resistors react to magnetic fields, with all resistors demonstrating a positive coefficient (+dR) in response to temperature changes. In the absence of a magnetic field, all resistors maintain equal value, resulting in output voltages Ul and Ur being half the bridge voltage. Temperature-induced resistance changes, equal in all resistors, will similarly maintain this half-bridge voltage balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when exposed to a magnetic field, two resistors increase their resistance while the other two decrease it. This creates a small but significant deviation from the half-bridge voltage, yielding a differential voltage ($U_r - U_l$). This differential voltage is then amplified by the instrumentation amplifier to a usable level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Bridge Output Voltage Dependency\n",
    "For a full bridge configuration with four sensitive resistors, the differential output voltage can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Uo = U_{bridge} \\cdot \\frac{dR}{R} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation indicates that the bridge's output voltage is directly proportional to its supply voltage. Increasing the bridge voltage enhances the signal strength! However, the maximum bridge voltage is constrained by the heat (power) tolerance of the bridge resistors.\n",
