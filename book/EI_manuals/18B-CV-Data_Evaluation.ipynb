    "\n",
    "A restricted implementation of the typical *Python* modules like *numpy* and *matplotlib* in the *Alpaca Kernel (Micropython)* significantly reduce the flexibility and the possibilities offered by these powerful modules forcing us to migrate some tasks to a *Python*-driven notebook (ipykernel) for evaluation of the results from the Potentiostat. Separating data evaluation from the data acquisition environment is nevertheless a common workflow in many commercially available devices, and one of the perhaps unexpected and advantageous outcomes of this approach is that the processed data becomes easily available for sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this short notebook as an inspiration and an example. The methods chosen for this notebook are not mandatory, and all *Python* tools are allowed.\n",
