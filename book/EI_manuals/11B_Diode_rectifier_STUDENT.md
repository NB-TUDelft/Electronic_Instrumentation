# 11B: Diode rectifier

> <font color='blue'>Learning goal:</font> Explain and understand fundamental properties of diode circuits 


* Extra information or hints is given in boxes denoted by: <font size=4>‚ÑπÔ∏è</font>
* Help fixing progrems is given in boxed denoted by: <font size=4>üî•</font>



Materials used:
- ALPACA
- A diode
- A capacitor of 47 $\mu$F
- A resistor of 1k $\Omega$
- A red LED

## Background: LED and rectifier
> <font color='grey'>‚è≥ Estimated time: 5 min</font>

During this exercise you will explore the functioning of a diode in different circuits. For this purpose, you will mostly be using a specific type of diode called a **Light Emitting Diode** (LED). An LED functions just like any other diode, with the added functionality of creating light when a current flows through it. The ALPACA has many LEDs already available on board, and you'll use these in circuits. A difference between a LED and other diodes is the voltage drop - LED's is higher at around 2V (depending on a LED type and manufacturer).


You already know that a capacitor has a frequency dependent impedance. It 'blocks' low frequency signals. When combining a clipper with a capacitor, you can make use of the frequency dependent impedance, and build a rectifier. In this experiment we will look at a half-wave rectifier, which makes a DC signal from AC input.

## Anticipate: LEDs and a Rectifier

**A)** Predict the blinking behavior of the LED in the circuit below with an input (at *DAC A*) of a square wave with a $V_{min}$ of 0 and $V_{max}$ of 1 V.
Explain which of the following answers is correct:
- no led will turn on
- only led A will blink
- only led C will blink
- both leds blink at the same time
- the leds blink alternatingly (either one on at any point in time)

Note: In a half wave rectifier only half of the sine wave passes through a diode, charging the capacitor. In the rest of the remaining period the capacitor will discharge, leading to the characteristic output signal.

## Implement & investigate 1: directionality and polarity of LEDs
> <font color='grey'>‚è≥ Estimated time: 25 min</font>

   
### 1a Implement the circuit 
You can use the LEDs that are present on the Alpaca to test the directionality and the polarity. Implement the circuit below.

In order to test this circuit you will write some Python code. Part of it is al ready written, but you will have to complete it. The code can be found in the cells below. 
    
* The code must be able to make a square wave ranging from 0 to 3 V. For the frequency, we will select a frequency at which we can easily see the changes in the LEDs by eye, say 1 Hz. You can do this using the function generator and the *DAC A* output. You must be able to set a certain frequency for this square wave. 
* Do **not** yet perform a measurement using the analog in pins during this first part of the exercise.

Part of the code is already written for you in the cells below. Comments with instructions are given at the places where you should complete it.

### 1d signal through DAC assistant
    

Let's change the circuit a slight bit again . Instead of using the output from the *DAC A* pin directly, we pass it through the *DAC Assistant* on the ALPACA. 
* Wire the signal of pin *DAC A* to the *+IN port* of the DAC assistant (right top of the ALPACA board, see image below). The output signal is now generated at the pin called *OUT*. Also see the circuit below.
* Note that for this part of the exercise both USB cables must be connected. Turn the two switches for the *+12V >ON* and *-12V >ON* supplies on, their indicator LEDS will glow now.

Because you're using the DAC assistant on the ALPACA, the square wave you create using the function generator will be turned into a square wave of the same frequency, but with a voltage from -10 to +10 V. You can see that your voltage range changed by using the voltmeter on the Cria, __but avoid connecting your signal to any of the input pins of the Pico__, this voltage range is harmful for your it!

    
* Observe the blinking pattern of the LED by running the code you wrote previously. What happened, and can you explain why this happened?

## Implement & investigate 2: half-wave rectifier

### 2a. build the setup
> <font color='grey'>‚è≥ Estimated time: 15 min</font>

Now we are going to build the last circuit for this exercise. 
* Unplug your ALPACA. (Always recommended when rebuilding)
* For this purpose, do not use one of the LEDs on the ALPACA, but **take the red LED that was supplied to you** together with the capacitors and resistors.
* Note that you'll no longer be needing the *DAC Assistant*
    
Build the circuit below using the breadboard on the ALPACA.
