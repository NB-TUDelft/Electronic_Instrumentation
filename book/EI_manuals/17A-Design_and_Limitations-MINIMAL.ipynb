    "> Using a relatively high `Rf` delivers a strong signal from the current-to-voltage converter, but it is cleverly chosen such that it doesn't saturate the converter's OPAMP output (`Ua < 10.8V`) in the entire range of the currents generated during the voltage sweep. Simultaneously, the attenuation 1:3 scales this signal down just right such that the entire range of the ADCs can be utilised for the measurement."
