# EI manuals week 6

## This week's goal: 
Use python code to control a stepper motor, a LED generating morse code, and a whack the mole game.

## Topic of experiments

- 6A: Use NIDAQ to control a stepper motor
- 6B: Generate a morse signal
- 6C: Whack the mole game

## ORIGINAL
Experiments of this week:
- experiment 6A: use NI-DAQ to create digital signals
- experiment 6B: use PicoPI to create a visual Morse signal and observe digital signals
- experiment 6C: program your Alpaca using a mix digital inputs and outputs

Goal: learn how to work with digital signals with NIDAQ and Alpaca
