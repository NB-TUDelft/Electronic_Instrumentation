# EI manuals week 11

## This week's goal: 
Design circuits with diodes, which can be used for clipping and rectifying the AC voltage. 

## Topic of experiments

- 11A: diode clipper
- 11B: half wave rectifier
- 11C: full wave rectifier

## ORIGINAL
Experiments of this week:
-   experiment 11A: make diode clippers
-   experiment 11B: build diode rectifier
-   experiment 11C: build a diode bridge

Goal: learn how to apply diodes in clippers and rectifiers
