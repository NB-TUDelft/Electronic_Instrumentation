# EI manuals week 16

## This week's goal: 
Build an oscillator, for which the output frequency depends on the input light intensity

## Topic of experiments
- Oscillator 16A: Background and Simulation
- Oscillator 16B: Assembly and Tests  
- Oscillator 16C: Light Sensor

## ORIGINAL
- Oscillator 16A: **Before** the Classroom Session - Background and Simulation
- Oscillator 16B: **Before** the Classroom Session - Assembly and Tests  
- Oscillator 16C: **During** the Classroom Session - Light Sensor
  
Goal:
- Build a complex circuit.
- Understand the role of the Relaxation Oscillator in processing of the signal from a light sensor <br>
