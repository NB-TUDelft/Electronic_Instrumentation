# EI manuals week 8

## This week's goal: 
Measure the response of an filter, and analyse the (aliased) measured freqeuncy

## Topic of experiments

- 8A: Automatically measure the (frequency) filter response 
- 8B: Measuring an aliased signal (single sine)
- 8C: Simulating combined signals (aliasing multiple sines)

## ORIGINAL
Experiments of this week:
- experiment 8A: use remote function generator to create signals and analize them
- experiment 8B: understand and be able to predict sine aliasing
- experiment 8C: understand and be able to predict multiple sines aliasing

Goal: understand how digital sampling influences the measurement and what causes aliasing
