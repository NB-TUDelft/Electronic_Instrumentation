# EI manuals week 13

## This week's goal: 
Limitations and Frequency dependent amplification with an opamp circuit

## Topic of experiments

- 13A: bias&offset
- 13B: opamp bandwidth
- 13C: integrator and differentiator

## ORIGINAL
Experiments of this week:
- Experiment 13A: observe the imperfections of a real life op-amp like bias and offset.
- Experiment 13B: observe the properties of an op-amp like GB product and slew rate.
- Experiment 13C: observe the behaviour of integrator and differentiator circuits.

Goal: Learn how op-amps are used in real life applications and what are their real life limitations.
