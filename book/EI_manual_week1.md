# EI manuals week 1

## This week's goal: 
Understanding voltage dividers: using multimeter, function generator and simulation

## Topic of experiments

- 1A: Multimeter measure voltage division
- 1B: Function generator as part of a voltage divider
- 1C: Simulate a combined voltage divider

## new equipment & circuit
- voltage divider = circuit to divide voltage
- multimeter= device to measure voltage and current
- function generator= device to generate a waveform
- simulation (LTSpice) = simulate how a circuit behaves without building it physically

## ORIGINAL
Experiments of this week:
-   experiment 1A: Work with a digital multimeter to measure a voltage divider
-   experiment 1B: Use a function generator to vary the voltage on the load resistance
-   experiment 1C: Design voltage dividers with LTSpice to change the output voltage

Goal: learn how to use function generator, digital multimeter and voltage dividers to measure and control circuits
