# EI manuals week 2

## This week's goal: 
Understanding the use of an oscilloscope (voltage, triggering) and the use of the ALPACA 

## Topic of experiments

- 2A: AC/DC coupling and frequency
- 2B: Triggering
- 2C: Thevenin equivalent with the ALPACA

## new equipment and circuits
- oscilloscope: measurement device to measure and display voltage
- triggering: a way to synchronize the start of a measurement
- ALPACA: Advanced Learning Platform for Analog Circuits and Automation, which you borrow for this course, and with a Raspberry Pico Pi which you can control with Python code. 

## ORIGINAL
Experiments of this week:
-   experiment 2A: Investigate the AC/DC coupling and the AC frequency dependency with the oscilloscope
-   experiment 2B: Apply the correct triggering between function generator and oscilloscope
-   experiment 2C: Use the picopi to measure the Thevenin equivalent of a circuit

Goal: Understanding the use of an oscilloscope (voltage, triggering) and the use of the ALPACA
