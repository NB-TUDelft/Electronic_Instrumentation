# EI manuals week 2

## This week's goal: 
Understanding the use of an oscilloscope (voltage, triggering) ad the use of the ALPACA 

## Topic of experiments

- 2A: AC/DC coupling and frequency
- 2B: Triggering
- 2C: Thevenin equivalent with the ALPACA

## new equipment and circuits
oscilloscope: measurement device to measure and display voltage
triggering: a way to synchronize the start of a measurement
ALPACA: Advanced Learning Platform for Analog Circuits and Automation, which you borrow for this course, and with a Raspberry Pico Pi which you can control with Python code.
