# EI manuals week 17

## Each week's goal:
Build and evaluate a voltammetry setup to measure:
- **resistor model (week 17)**
- buffer solution (week 18)
- paracetamol (week 19)


## Topic of experiments
- 17A: Design and Limitation
- 17B: Testing and Calibration
- 17C: Evaluate the setup with a resistor model
** note: these manuals are work in progress for 2025, you see the 2024 version now
