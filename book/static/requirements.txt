## Minimal runtime deps to run notebooks in VS Code
# VS Code uses its own notebook UI; you do NOT need 'jupyter', 'notebook', or 'jupyterlab'.
# Keep these two so the Python kernel works and widgets render in VS Code.
ipykernel
ipywidgets
alpaca_kernel_2    # For ALPACA-specific kernel usage

## Scientific stack used throughout the notebooks (keep)
numpy
scipy
matplotlib

## Instrumentation/IO used by exercises (keep)
pyvisa
nidaqmx-python

## Optional/advanced tools â€” NOT required to run in VS Code
# Uncomment only if you need the specific workflow locally.
# nbconvert         # For exporting notebooks (e.g., to HTML/PDF)
# nbclient          # For programmatic notebook execution
# nbgrader          # For grading workflows; not needed for runtime
# jupytext          # For syncing .ipynb <-> .md/.py paired files
# markdown          # For programmatic Markdown-to-HTML rendering
