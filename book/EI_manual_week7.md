# EI manuals week 7

## This week's goal: 
Measure and analyse input signals (voltage and light)

## Topic of experiments

- 7A: Measure voltage with NIDAQ
- 7B: Fourier transform with Python code
- 7C: receive and decode a Morse signal

## ORIGINAL
Experiments of this week:
- Experiment 7A: Use NI-DAQ to acquire analog signals 
- Experiment 7B: Write a function that calculates the fourier transform 
- Experiment 7C: Receive and decode Morse code

Goal: Acquiring analog signals with NIDAQ, plus writing and testing code for the Fourier transfrom and to decode the Morse signal (from 6B)
