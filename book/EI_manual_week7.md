# EI manuals week 7

## This week's goal: 
Measure and analyse analog signals with (micro)python

## Topic of experiments

- 7A: Measure AC-voltage with NIDAQ
- 7B: Fourier transform with Python 
- 7C: Receive and decode a Morse code signal 
    - original: with photodiode and opamp
    - alternative 1: record morse with push button
    - alternative 2: record with IR and PWM  (under construction)
