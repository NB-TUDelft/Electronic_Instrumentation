# EI manuals octal 1

This is a way to share the the practicum manuals from NB2214 Electronic Instrumentation to a larger audience. 

The topics are as follows:

- 1A_DMM+voltage_divider: influence of voltmeter on measurement, use of power supply
- 1B_output_function_generator: influence of function generator on measurement
- 1C_LTSpice_Intro_STUDENT: use of electronic circuit simulation, simulate stacked divider
- 2A_using_a_scope_STUDENT: use of scope
- 2B_triggering_STUDENT: use of triggering
- 2C_Thevenin_equivalent_with_picoPI_STUDENT: use of Alpaca, measure Thevenin voltage
- 3A_RC-RL_circuits_STUDENT: filter in time domain
- 3B_scope_probes_STUDENT: counteract capacitance in coax cable
- 3C_ground_loop_STUDENT: what is a ground loop, how to avoid
- 4A_Fourier_Transform_STUDENT, use the scope for frequency analysis, FFT of a signal
- 4B_RC_STUDENTv2, filter in frequency domain
- 4C_RCCR_STUDENT_v2, band pass in frequency domain
