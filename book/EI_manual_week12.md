# EI manuals week 12

## This week's goal: 
Use opamps to amplify and/or convert your singal, and measure with the ALPACA

## Topic of experiments

- 11A: non-inverting opamp
- 11B: inverting opamp
- 11C: current to voltage converter

## ORIGINAL
Experiments of this week:
- experiment 12A: Simulate and build a non-inverting opamp
- experiment 12B: Simulate and build an inverting opamp
- experiment 12C: Build a current to voltage converter and understand how it works

Goal: In these experiments we will explore the basic OPAMP circuits and learn about the photodiode. 

There are two basic OPAMP circuits, the inverting and the non-inverting amplifier, most other OPAMP based circuits are derived from these two circuits. These circuits work for both AC and DC signals. During the experiments we will see what the difference is between AC-coupling and DC-coupling of signals, as well.
OPAMPs are very often used in conjunction with sensors. Example of a sensor, often used in biochemical systems, is the photodiode. The photodiode is sensitive to light. It can be read out in two different modes; voltage mode and current mode. In voltage mode it will act as a “solar cell”, this gives with low light intensity already a voltage. However, the voltage mode is not linear. When used as an intensity sensor, with high linearity, the current mode is more suited. In order to convert the photocurrent to a voltage, a circuit with an OPAMP is used, the current to voltage converter.
