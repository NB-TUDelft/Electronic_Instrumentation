# Welcome to the Online Manuals of the NB2214 practicum

This Teachbook is meant to be able to open all NB2214 Practicum manuals without having to open the jupyter notebook on your laptop. If you want to, you can still download this notebook and work offline, which is mainly needed when connecting to equipment such as the ALPACA, or NIDAQ. 

## Expected of you
homework = Background+Anticipate + Simulate
on campus during practical sessions: Implement&Investigate + Compare & Conclude

Each section has some guidelines on how much time to spend. If you add all it will be (far) more than the 4 practical hours we have per week, hence you should prepare on beforehand. 

Each experiment will be evaluated with a teaching assistant (TA), and you can only participate in the intermediate exams after completing all experiments of that octal. 

## Default manual structure
The overall structure of each experiment is BASIC:
- Background
- Anticipate
- Simulate
- Implement & Investigate
- Compare and Conclude. 

### Background
The background is a quick repeat of theory necessary to know before doing the experiment. This is to refreash your mind, and is not study material on its own. We refer you to the textbook for a theoretical, more structured way of gathering knowledge on electronic instrumentation. 

**This part is done prepatory and alone**

### Anticipate
It is better to think before act. During the prediction phase of the experiment you activate knowledge to predict the outcome of a measurement. This already gives you directions of what to expect (and what not to expect). 

**This part is done prepatory and alone**

### Simulate
Before doing measurements, you verify your predictions by running a simulation. If later on your measurement resuts are not in line with the prediction, you cannot deduct the cause of the inconsistency. With simulations, you can. 

**This part is done prepatory and alone**

## Implement & investigate
You will do measurements, often starting with running the experiment you predicted and simulated. In further steps you continu to vary parameters and investigate into more depth. 

**This part is done in groups of two in the studio classroom**

### Compare & Conclude
After doing the experiments you compare your predictions, simulations and measurement results. If not in agreement, you seek for explanations. If in agreement, you think about further improvements. 

**This part is done in groups of four, so two groups per table, in the studio classroom**
* Wait till all (4) group members finish their observation
* Compare your results with your other group members. 
* If your results agree, and are in line with all predictions, then talk to a TA and get checked off
* Otherwise, so if your results do not agree, or your results are not in line with your predictions, then first discuss amongst your group before getting a TA. 

You answer the evaluating questions (per experiment manual) and then **discuss with a TA**. 


Students are encouraged to answer the questions and then write what they learned in the following format, which can go into an electronic labjournal:
- 1. Write a brief abstract on what you learned (conclusion, useful graph), 
- 2. Which troubleshooting skills do you want to remember for next sessions, 
- 3. Which code do you copy for use in next sessions,
- 4. How do think this notebook could be improved
