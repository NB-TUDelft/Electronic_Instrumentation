# Welcome to the Template Book

This Teachbook is meant to be able to open all NB2214 Practicum manuals without having to open the jupyer notebook on your laptop. If you want to, you can still download this notebook and work offline. 

ideas for further development:
- make separate intros to ALPACA, LTSPice, scope, multimeter, function generator, power supply. When devices are upgraded, the assignments do not have to be updated.
- power supply + DMM in 1A
- func gen in 1B
- LTSpice (old version) in 1C
- scope 2A, trigger 2B
- ALPACA intro in 2C

arrange manuals per octal. 

each manual contains BASIC. 
- where possible move basic from assignment to book.
- each manual should be doable in manageable amount of time.
- focus on design, not only implement
