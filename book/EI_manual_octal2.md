this octal focuses on the interplay between software and hardware.   

It contains:
- 6A NI-DAQ + Stepper motor : use logic digital out to make a motor spin
- 6B logic+morse : send out a morse code
- 6C Whack-a-mole : program your ALPACA to light up a LED and with a button press the LED turns off
- 7A Analog Inputs : record a signal with NIDAQ
- 7B Fourier Transform Python : write your own FFT code, to be re-used multiple times
- 7C receive Morse : can you receive and understand what you sent?
- 8A Automated filter response : determine the filter response automatically
- 8B Aliasing a single sine : explore aliasing
- 8C Aliasing multiple sines : explore how aliasing can be constructive or destructive
- 9A Anti-Aliasing: counteract aliasing with an analog filter
- 9B Digital Filtering and Averaging : what works better to diminish noise
- 9C Signal Denoising by Average: averaging an untriggered signal
