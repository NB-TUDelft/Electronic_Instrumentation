# EI manuals week 9

## This week's goal: 
Know and be able to select the best signal optimization: anti-aliasing, digital filtering, and averaging. 

## Topic of experiments

- 9A: Using an analog filter for anti-aliasing
- 9B: Digital filtering and averaging
- 9C: Averaging an untriggered signal

## ORIGINAL
Experiments of this week:
- Experiment 9A: perform Anti-Aliasing using analog filter
- Experiment 9B: use Digital Filtering and Averaging to improve signal quality
- Experiment 9C: apply Signal Denoising by phase shifiting & averaging

Goal: Explore three types of filters (anti-aliasing, digital filtering and averaging) and determine which type of filter is best for which signal
