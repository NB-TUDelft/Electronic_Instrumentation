# EI manuals week 14

## This week's goal: 
Limitations and Frequency dependent amplification with an opamp circuit

## Topic of experiments

- 14A: differential and common mode
- 14B: comparator and hysteresis
- 14C: magnet sensor with readout through Wheatstone bridge

## ORIGINAL
Experiments of this week:
- experiment 14A: simulate a circuit to understand how differential mode is amplified and common mode is rejected
- experiment 14B: build a comparator (with hysteresis) circuit and explain its behaviour
- experiment 14C: build a magnetic sensor using instrumentation amplifer and understand how it works

Goal: Understand the use of differential mode, bridge sensors, a comparator (with positive feedback), and sensing a magnetic field.
