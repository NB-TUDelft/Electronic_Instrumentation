# EI manuals week 3

## This week's goal: 
understand time & frequency behavior, and common grounds, in circuits

## Topic of experiments

- 3A: RC-RL circuit behavior
- 3B: Scope probe
- 3C: common grounds

 ## ORIGINAL
 Experiments of this week:
- experiment 3A: build and design RC and RL circuits and observe their behaviour
- experiment 3B: use scope probes and see when it is beneficial to use them
- experiment 3C: cause a ground loop and explain how it is happening

Goal: learn how to design simple filters and how equipment you use affects your measurements
